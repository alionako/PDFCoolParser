<h1>PdfCoolParser</h1>
PdfCoolParser is my coursework project that aimed to deal with the problem of conversion of PDF files to other formats. Classes that are within this project reflect structures existing in PDF documents. Currently it supports reading input streams and decomposing it into set of predefined structures.
